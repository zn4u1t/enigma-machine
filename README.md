Welcome to the Digital Enigma Machine!!!!
The purpose of this machine is to encrypt and decrypt a secret message based on parts of the original Enigma Machine. 

How to use:
===========

1. This step is only necassary if the folder Static does not exist, or if you need a new encryption set.
	1a. Double click on the file named MAKE_STATIC.py. This generates static wheels for encryption. In order for encryption and decryption to work together you will need the same static wheels.   
2. Open the enigma.py program and encrypt/decrypt as much as you want!
3. Keep your messages safe!
4. You can e-mail yourself the encryption. Decryption is to a flat file only!!!
	4a. All user requested data (name, email) is deleted upon exit of program.

Note:
=========
All files are exported with in the original program folder.
Encryption and decryption export to two different files. Encryption output = MESSAGE.txt, Decryption output = DECRYPTION.txt
Upon exiting the program, it will delete most files asssociated with it, be sure to copy out any info you may need.

WARNING!!!!
===============
EVERYTIME you re-run an encrpyt/decrypt command in the enigma machine, the previously made file will be over written.
